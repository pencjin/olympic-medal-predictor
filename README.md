# 🎖️ Olympic Medal Predictor

This project analyzes Olympic medal data from 1980 to 2016 and builds predictive models to estimate the number of medals an athlete is likely to win based on their **age**, **height**, **weight**, and **host country status**.

It also includes a Shiny dashboard that allows users to interactively test athlete input variables and visualize country trends.
